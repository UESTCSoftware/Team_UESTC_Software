"2009_Aberdeen_Scotland";"Damage to inaccessible pipe systems, such as computer cooling circuits, is difficult to rectify. An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.";"A Synthetic Biology Approach to Pipe Repair: The Pico-Plumber";"pipe repair;timing of lysis;cell lysis;Pipe breach detection;quorum sensing;inaccessible pipe systems;restoration of pipe integrity;lysis timing modules;component protein-based glue;based parameter database;gate;component glue concept;genetic circuit;agent-based model of E;coli cells;Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit;effective radii of cell migration;rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values;lysyl oxidase;computer cooling circuits;lac inducer IPTG;alpha-omega complementation of beta;exploitation of chemotaxis;galatosidase activity;stochastic models;tropoelastin;Damage;proposal;inputs;Control;";"http://igem.org/2009_Judging_Form?id=182"
"2009_Alberta";"The creation of simplified artificial cells with specialized functions, along design principles that are compatible with the goals of synthetic biology, requires advances in two key areas. In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome.

This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene.

With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein. If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed. This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars). To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors. The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs. Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection.";"Bacterial Decoder";"Bacterial Decoder;decoder function;arabinose;binary inputs;engineer;outputs;different fluorescent protein;Green Fluorescent Protein;logic devices;presence of lactose;multiple environmental cues;combinations of small non-coding RNAs;medical diagnostics;implications;transcription factors;sense;water contaminant detection;low-level computer architecture;specific combination;Illinois iGEM team;standard parts;Decoders;coli;system;sugars;";"http://igem.org/2009_Judging_Form?id=252"

Whereas expression of relB protein?antitoxin? and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity.

Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce. Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency. While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering.

Nuclear receptors are a conserved family of proteins responsible for sensing lipids; they may be viewed as lipid activated transcription factors. We have successfully developed a kit with a variety of lipid responsive domains (from H.sapines, D.melanogaster and C.elegans) for the rational construction of synthetic transcription factors. The domains respond only to predefined lipids and selectively activate predetermined gene expression. To characterize theses domains, we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity.

The latest induced output will remain stable through generations, even once the input ceases, due to the phage regulatory systems. We present the framework for this development and characterize the regulatory mechanisms by using fluorescent proteins as the reporter (outputs). The dynamics of the system have been modeled and we have also attempted to characterize and submit the promoters, repressors and anti-repressors from the salmonella phages, as well as the two anti-terminator proteins from the lambda phage, as BioBricks.

By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.";"EscheRatio coli: Novel Sensors to Detect a Ratio of Environmental Inputs";"output promoter;types of ratio;output gene;unique small RNAs;number of small RNAs;transcription rate;phosphorylatable protein;environmental factors;chemical inputs;majority of sensors;specific flourescent protein;complex input data;different input ratios;Stanford team;synthetic biology;production;absolute concentration;outputs;kinase;tipping point;activity;concentrations of multiple chemicals;phosphatase;important biological processes;systems capable;operons;";"http://igem.org/2010_Judging_Form?id=353"

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients.

E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++.

Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited. However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient. The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.

Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7C, possibly even allowing growth near 0C.

Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37C.

Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes.

"2011_NTNU_Trondheim";"""ppGpp (Guanosine pyrophosfate) is a global regulator of gene expression in bacteria. Production of ppGpp up-regulates central genes for starvation survival, and down-regulates genes involved in growth and proliferation, e.g. rRNA operons and the rrnB P1 promoter. ppGpp production is induced by amino acid starvation and other general stress and starvation factors, making this signal molecule suitable for monitoring stress in bacteria.

The sensor consists of two parts. mCherry (a red fluorescent protein) controlled by the Lac promoter, and the Lac Inhibitor controlled by the rrnB P1 promoter.

We observed a statistically significant reduction in fluorescence during growth compared to cultures with IPTG-inhibited LacI, demonstrating lacI production by rrnB P1. Results suggest that the rrnB P1 promoter produces less lacI when the cells are grown in minimal medium, possibly due to amino-acid starvation and ppGpp shutting it down.

We created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis. We developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.";"e-candi: Engineering the Fourth Polymer of Life";"designer polysaccharides;polymer construction;chemical modification of polysaccharides;biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides;arrangement;novel polymer sequence;relationships;biosynthetic system;synthetic chemistry;GTase donor;synthetic biology;Escherichia coli;GTase database;chemical nature;properties stem;endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis;spectacular range of properties;mathematical modeling;acceptor characterization assay;time-consuming production;order;user-friendly interface;sugars;e-candi;foods;generation;Scientists;biobricks;glues;project;performance;work;";"http://igem.org/2012_Judging_Form?id=764"

Furthermore microbial production of these sweetening compounds could also lower the environmental costs of Sweetener production. In addition to these advantages, it would be possible to selectively produce only the most flavorful compounds.

The possible adaption of such circuits into cellular environments can amplify the scale and complexity of biological circuits, broadening synthetic biology’s application space. Our project leverages strand displacement to create a process technology that supports multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely-regulated actuation in mammalian cells.

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.";"iRICE: A Novel, Non-GM Approach to Biofortification of Rice";"starch-binding domain;thiamine-binding domain;vitamin B12-binding domain;fortifying rice;white rice;Supplementing rice;cooked rice;specific nutrient-binding domains;fusion proteins;nutrient leeching;poor source of nutrients;cooking;vitamin powders;washing process;major source of calories;novel;non-GMO approach;lysine-rich protein;approaches;limited success;world’s population;vitamins;RFP;grains;losses;problem;";"http://igem.org/2012_Judging_Form?id=931"

To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle.

Also, a self-regulating bacterial culture with intra consortial dependencies offers great advances in biosafety. To shut down the whole bacterial consortium, only on strain has to be eliminated. We engineer three different E. coli strains to grow in a consortium exploiting different Quorum Sensing systems. Each strain maintains a constitutive expression of an inactive transcription activator (LuxR, LasR or RhlR). Inducers are synthesized by different synthases (LuxI, LasI or RhlI) that are each expressed in one strain and subsequently secreted into the medium. Once taken up by a cell, the inducers bind to the corresponding, inactive transcription factors to render them functional.

The next-generation of strains could be “programmable,” with on demand generation of molecules within a bioreactor e.g. a yogurt fermentation capable of making any combination of flavouring, nutrients or pharmaceuticals. While merging all this potential into single hosts seems efficient, it would also bring added risk in the case of a process failure due to bacteriophage infection. Here, we not only rationally design widespread immunity to phage infection, but also hack this immunity system to yield programmable biosynthesis at the community level. We demonstrate this by building both broadly and specifically neutralizing CRISPR systems that were paired with biosynthetic capabilities for vanillin, caffeine and cinnamaldehyde production.

Nowadays, iron overload is mainly treated by bloodlettings for hemochromatosic patients but this treatment cannot be extended to thalassemic patients who suffer from anaemia. The aim of our project is to prevent the intestinal absorption of iron by engineering Escherichia coli to produce siderophores, chelators of iron. This strategy acts directly at the source.
We engineer Escherichia coli using the Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) couple to an inverter system, in order to produce these siderophores in presence of iron. To reduce the patient's iron absorption, our bacteria is encapsulated in a pill. Once it arrives in the duodenum, our bacteria will produce the siderophore at their full potential and chelate the iron.";"Iron coli Project";"iron overload;chelators of iron;presence of iron;intestinal absorption of iron;patient's iron absorption;siderophores;project;bacteria;engineering Escherichia coli;thalassemic patients;hemochromatosic patients;FUR;couple;Ferric Uptake Regulation;treatment;bloodlettings;inverter system;order;diseases;hemochromatosis;thalassemia;strategy acts;source;anaemia;year;aim;pill;duodenum;";"http://igem.org/2013_Judging_Form?id=1163"

Aflatoxin contamination of foods that are found in many developing countries may cause a serious problem for human health. ITB_Indonesia team for iGEM 2013 focuses on designing a whole cell biosensor for aflatoxin B1 detection in foods. The biosensor uses Escherichia coli as the chassis to build a genetic circuit using SOS response system to detect DNA damage caused by aflatoxin B1-oxide attack. The SOS response promoter is followed by a reporter gene coding a chromoprotein, therefore the concentration of aflatoxin B1 in food samples could be easily detected by the color change of the bacteria.

       Using our background in bioengineering we suggest an innovative alternative: Our idea is based on heterologues expression of SrUCP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorula glutinis. Through the expression plasmid, yeasts are transformed from the wild-type phenotype into a thermogenic phenotype.
       To implement this idea and make it simple and efficient, we plan to drive the expression of SrUCP under the control of cold shock promoter Tir1. In this way, yeasts will generate heat only when the temperatures drop.

The transcriptional regulators for each typical class of aromatic compounds were bioinformatically determined and promoter engineering and protein engineering were performed to tune their function. To expand the detection range, enzymes in upper pathways, working as plug-ins, were coupled with biosensors to degrade aromatics to detectable compounds. For environmental detection, we construct the band pass filter to detect a certain range of concentration. Responses of biosensors equipped with band-pass filter can robustly reflect the concentration of environmental samples.

The hypoxic microenvironment present in tumors can be used for the localized induction module of tumor specific proteins, using the promoters HIP and nirB.

We constructed and characterized a device named Alk-Sensor, which can sensitively detect a wide range of alkanes and generate certain response. Alk-Sensor is composed of ALKR protein——a transcriptional regulatory protein, and promoter alkM. ALKR recognizes alkanes and their interaction triggered a conformation change of ALKR dimers which isomerizes the promoter-RNAP complex and led to activate the downstream genes of PalkM.

Based on Alk-Sensor, we built a relationship between productivity of alkanes with strain’s growth rate under certain environmental stress. Starting from this relationship we further designed a novel selection method to select out the engineered strains with highest productivity of alkanes.

The Peptidor project consists of an E. coli that can detect S. aureus, using S. aureus’ native quorum sensing system, in order to locally produce and deliver AMPs. Upon detection, peptides inactivated by a SUMO-tag fusion, are overexpressed. After a delay period, introduced through a negative transcriptional cascade, a SUMO protease is expressed cleaving off the inactivating tag. Using this mechanism, high concentrations of peptide are delivered at the infection to efficiently kill S. aureus.

The system works by synthesising ethylene or methyl salicylate (MeSA) upon photoinduction. Everything is housed in a vending machine-like enclosure that regulates fruit ripening in response to consumer demand. Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that is widely used to ripen fruit, such as bananas and kiwi. However, the synthesis, handling, and storage of ethylene is expensive and dangerous. In contrast, B. fruity produces ethylene from inexpensive material by exploiting a TCA cycle intermediate, 2-oxoglutarate, and the activity of P. syringae 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase. The inhibition of fruit ripening results from the synthesis of MeSA via a pathway built with wintergreen parts.

This allows the network to maintain sensitivity despite noise, and also permits response to stimuli in a much larger dynamic range. By modifying the promoter driving the stimulus, the network can be engineered to detect fold-changes of any molecule with a responsive promoter, thereby serving as a structural chassis for the next generation of molecule detectors.

Two E.coli strains were generated, each expressing a distinct surface epitope and either a quorum sensing (QS) sender or receiver module respectively. Immune pull-down of each strain, and their subsequent co-culture, produced a quorum signal, indicating successful detection of two distinct antibody populations in a serum sample.

Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence. One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”. This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains. While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker. Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence.

In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-repeating proteins, massive　one, and to improve translation efficiency. That is, allowing ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism by producing circular mRNA and causing a defect of termination codon. To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage. Splicing is a mechanism removing circular introns and joining in exons after transcription. Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences at both ends of intron as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from introns to exons. We would like to clone the two parts of intron to use this mechanism and cyclize mRNA, making plasmids which include a gene coding proteins between those. And, by transforming E.coli, we get world’s longest proteins.";"Circular mRNA - the world's longest protein";"circular mRNA;semi-permanent translation mechanism;splicing mechanism of T4 phage;circular introns;translation efficiency;repeating proteins;exons;world’s longest proteins;gene coding proteins;binding ribosome;initiation codon;separating ribosome;parts of intron;defect of termination codon;single-strand RNA;plasmids;coli;nucleophilic attack;method of synthesizing;ribozyme;ribosomes;base sequences;transcription;study;";"http://igem.org/2014_Judging_Form?id=1332"

We attempted to create a recombinase switch which would, in response to arabinose, switch from encoding a flagellar gene, to two genes that encode gas vesicle formation, namely gvpA and gvpC. This switch could be applied to many areas, e.g. desalination, biofuel production and drug production, by simply changing the stimulus that would cause the switch to “flip”. Computer modelling showed that swimming was detrimental to floatation. In response we created knockouts of two different flagellar genes, motA and fliC. In vivo Gvp expression is toxic to E. coli.

Exploiting bacterial communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing is a promising strategy to specifically target certain pathogens. The major aim of this project is the introduction of a genetic circuit enabling Bacillus subtilis to actively detect, attach to, and eventually kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initially, we will introduce the autoinducer-sensing two-component systems of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into B. subtilis to create a pathogen-detecting strain. By utilizing quorum sensing-dependent promoters, we will then trigger pathogen-killing strategies like the production of antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation. As a safety measure a delayed suicide-switch guarantees non-persistence of genetically modified B. subtilis in the absence of pathogens.

Previously, a synthesized gene encoding geraniol synthase was expressed in M. maripaludis, and geraniol production was quantified as 0.2% of lipid dry weight using GC/MS. In order to optimize geraniol production, we are experimenting a combination of chemical, biological and computational approaches that include: an improved geraniol extraction procedure resulting in better recovery, a fluorescent protein monitor for protein expression and regulation, a synthetic ribosome-binding-site library enabling variable levels of expression, and a metabolic model of the lipid biosynthesis pathway subjected to flux balance analysis.";"ESTABLISHING METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA AS AN ALTERNATIVE PLATFORM FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY";"production of geraniol;geraniol production;geraniol synthase;synthetic biology available;protein expression;synthetic ribosome-binding;improved geraniol extraction procedure;utility of archaea;research;Methanococcus maripaludis;fluorescent protein monitor;variable levels of expression;lipid biosynthesis pathway;lipid dry weight;better recovery;site library;regulation;metabolic model;computational approaches;flux balance analysis;methanogenic archaeon;genetic tools;combination of chemical;GC;order;alternative platform;organism;synthesized gene;primary focuses;study;bacterium;coli;";"http://igem.org/2014_Judging_Form?id=1383"

This gene codes for β-galactosidase which can be split into two parts: β-galactosidase α and β-galactosidase β. The functional enzyme consisting of one alpha and one beta part hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose.

P. marinus infection requires recognition of a four-domain galectin protein, CvGal1, produced by oyster hemocytes to capture bacteria by binding surface sugars. P. marinus targets CvGal1 using unknown carbohydrate ligands on the protest surface. As a first step in generating a bacterial biosensor for P. marinus, a recombinant OmpA-CvGal1 protein was engineered to anchor on the E. coli outer cell membrane. OmpA fusions with mammalian two-domain galectins were similarly engineered to investigate the effect of galectin size on the efficiency of membrane display and pathogen recognition.

To tackle the issue of transportation emissions, we want to produce sustainable propane in Escherichia coli using cellulosic feedstock. The pathway is a patchwork of 10 different enzymes from different organisms, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Bacillus subtilis. We built a model of the pathway to identify its bottlenecks and concentrate our engineering efforts on them. To elevate our propane from a food crop -based first generation biofuel to the second generation, we are integrating a secretion system for cellulose hydrolysing enzymes. To innovatively enhance our production system, we are bringing the two final enzymes of our pathway into close proximity by fusing them with micelle-forming amphiphilic proteins. This increases theoretical yield, bringing us one step closer to commercially viable biopropane.";"Fuel for the Future: E. coli producing renewable propane from cellulose";"pathway;different enzymes;final enzymes;production system;cellulose hydrolysing enzymes;issue of transportation emissions;different organisms;sustainable propane;generation biofuel;secretion system;electricity production;man-made CO2 emissions;Mycobacterium marinum;Escherichia coli;step closer;cellulosic feedstock;close proximity;micelle;food crop;patchwork;viable biopropane;Bacillus subtilis;bottlenecks;theoretical yield;primary cause;greatest challenges;mankind;engineering efforts;amphiphilic proteins;Climate change;model;";"http://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1655"

This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the host’s own genetic material also influenced device stability.

Finally co-transforming them into E.coli lead to magnetotaxis.The magnetotactic E.coli has a variety of applacations, such as targeted therapy,dealing with environmental pollution and so on.We focus on the application of microbial fuel cell(MFC).Fixing the laccase protein on the MTE membrane can make the laccase adhere to cathode stronger.Therefore we can replace the conventional platinum anode with biology catalyst.";"The magical magnetotactic E.coli (MTE) generating electricity";"magnetotactic E;MTB;coli lead;magical bacterium-magnetotactic bacterium;biology catalyst;MTE membrane;property of magnetotaxis;laccase protein;application value;main operons;synthetic biology methods;application of microbial fuel cell;hard culture condition;complex operation;MFC;genome-wide;molecular level;targeted therapy;magnetosome formation;previous researches;variety of applacations;conventional platinum anode;gryphiswaldense strain MSR;environmental pollution;relevant genes;organisms;cathode stronger;project;use;plasmids;";"http://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1779"

Increased transcription of FadD will allow our strain to better utilize frying oil waste. Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields.

They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics.

Although fermentation enriches foods with some essential vitamins and amino acids, many regions of the subcontinent still suffer from high malnutrition. We are addressing this problem by engineering S. cerevisiae and lactobacilli, commonly found in Indian fermented rice dishes, to enrich foods with vitamins A, B2, and B12, and bioavailable iron.
We also implemented a differentiation system for reducing the fitness cost of over-expression of multiple pathways, and an easy E. coli sensor for measuring vitamin concentration using a riboswitch.
Our user-centered approach incorporates a low-cost and open hardware framework, both for growing and distributing starter cultures, and for quality control. This will give local affected populations power over their own food, as opposed to other GMO nutritional enrichment strategies, by allowing them to grow their own source of vitamins.";"Ferment It Yourself";"foods;essential vitamins;Indian subcontinent;source of vitamins;Food fermentation;Indian fermented rice dishes;fitness cost of over-expression of multiple pathways;lactobacilli;amino acids;vitamin concentration;coli sensor;user-centered approach;open hardware framework;B12;B2;regions;local affected populations power;GMO nutritional enrichment strategies;starter cultures;quality control;problem;engineering;cerevisiae;differentiation system;bioavailable iron;world;riboswitch;high malnutrition;";"http://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1678"

However, most projects involve a risk of GEOs dissemination outside the laboratory, which raises environmental issues. To prevent such a risk, we designed a biosafety system that would prevent or at least dramatically limit the chances of accidental GEO spreading. The system consists in both a physical confinement which still allows the GEO to carry out its main function, and a temperature-based containment which ensures the survival of the organism in a restricted temperature range. Escherichia coli was chosen to implement the temperature based system due to its wide use in the iGEM projects.

Although tuberculosis is curable and the treatment success rate is high, it is still the second most common cause of death from infectious disease. Most of the deaths occur for lack of effective identification of those in need of therapy. Case detection is currently the rate-limiting step in TB control. A diagnostic tool with high sensitivities and specificities is desired urgently, and it is supposed to be used at the point-of-care within a clinic or in the community.
To obviate such problems, Peking iGEM is developing a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection system that can transform biomarkers of TB into optical signal or electric signal.

We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy. cGMP can transduce nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. We up-regulate the soluble guanylate cyclase(sGC), an enzyme that synthesize cGMP from GTP，by overexpressing the α and β subunits of sGC in a mammalian cell line.

The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3’-diketo-trehalose (3,3’dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing β-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies. Consequently ExTermite coli can effectively exterminate termites in their nest.";"ExTermite coli: A new system to exterminate termites using engineered E. coli and pseudo egg";"ExTermite coli;trehalose metabolism;diketo-trehalose;engineered Escherichia coli;habit termites;G3DH;termites present;termite egg-recognition molecules;unique pseudo-egg delivery system;egg-recognition pheromones;termite bodies;novel system;pseudo eggs;insecticide;nests;major termite blood sugar;trehalase inhibitor;advantage;sensing β-glucosidase;lysozyme;glucose;dehydrogenase;dkt;";"http://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1765"

We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs. The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system.

To achieve this, we combine the CRP activator, a regulatory protein activated by cAMP, with red fluorescent protein (RPF) as a reporter of expression level. Since glucose concentration is reversely related with cAMP level, a change of glucose level can influence the binding of CRP with target operon, thus altering the fluorescent intensity.

Our team sought to develop a “digitized-analog” expression system using CRISPR-dCas9, capable of specifying varied exogenous gene expression levels based on different signals. We first developed digital elements by pairing gRNAs with minimal operator promoters and using dCas9 to transactivate. We then created analog elements by multimerizing operator sites to obtain graded activation levels. Finally, we integrated our digital and analog elements into higher-order genetic logic circuits to achieve varying expression responses. We characterized and optimized our system in human cells, enabling synthetic biologists to better control transgene expression for important therapeutic applications.";"Gemini: Combining Digital and Analog Expression Systems";"expression system;analog elements;controlling expression;digital elements;digitized-analog;analog capacity;varying expression responses;varied exogenous gene expression levels;better control transgene expression;synthetic systems;graded activation levels;synthetic biologists;CRISPR-dCas9;different signals;natural systems;multimerizing operator sites;minimal operator promoters;higher-order genetic logic circuits;important therapeutic applications;gRNAs;human cells;transactivate;team;";"http://igem.org/2016_Judging_Form?id=1875"

However, efficient deconstruction and valorization of biomass remains a hindrance to its utilization in next generation biorefineries. To harvest the fermentable sugars and aromatics in plant biomass, a consolidated bioprocessing approach is currently needed to provide a cost effective and efficient scheme for funneling lignocellulose into high-value biochemicals.

Current diagnostic methods are invasive and rely on biomarkers that are not sufficiently disease-specific. We have engineered E. coli to detect several disease-specific biomarkers, memorize this event, and allow specific readout of the memory state. While the sensor cells travel through the gut, simultaneously occurring signals are memorized by activating an AND gate which triggers a recombination-based unidirectional switch and commits the observation to memory. After isolation from the patient’s faeces, the memory can be read out through the expression of a fluorescent protein induced by the addition of the candidate biomarker. Thus a single fluorescent protein can differentiate between many different candidate markers. A community of sensor cells can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing.

The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricksTM for E. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs.

A non-invasive sweat patch that provides real-time monitoring of blood ethanol levels would revolutionise how we control alcohol consumption. Our proposed prototype, AlcoPatch, is based on studies that demonstrate the correlation between sweat and blood ethanol concentrations. Our AlcoPatch utilizes Escherichia coli as a chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. The first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from Pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. The second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from Aspergillus nidulans, to regulate the expression of chromoproteins. To guide our experiments, we use an innovative ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainty in our parameters.

Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (??G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.";"Cistrons Concerto";"different stem-loops;different expression level;different mRNA;stem loops' resistance;different stability;gene expression level;stoichiometry expression;polycistron gene expression construct;designed Gibbs free energy;encoded proteins;target proteins;endoribonuclease cleavage site;linear counterpart;independent mRNAs;operon;longer half-life;team;polynucleotides;single-stranded ones;exoribonucleases;beautiful concerto of cistrons;way;addition;";"http://igem.org/2016_Judging_Form?id=2047"

We can then measure the concentration of penicillin by measuring the fluorescence intensity on the plate. To even further reduce the cost and strengthen the sensitivity of the test, we create a test paper by binding our fusion protein CBD (cellulose binding domain)-PBP5 to filter paper.

Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics. In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection. With our device, we potentially have the capability of rapidly determining the presence of any bacterial infection, enabling us to combat the mis-prescription of antibiotics.";"Iron & Blood: Using synthetic biology to develop a tool to diagnose bacterial infections";"bacterial infection results;bacterial infections;device;mis-prescription;Over-prescription of antibiotics;siderophores;lipocalin;Antibiotic resistance;weak GFP signal;strong signal;levels of RyhB;global health;iron-dependant repressor;World Health Organisation;contrast;utilising Fur;major issue;patients;inverter;difference;biggest threats;response;immune system;Fe3;reporter protein;war;presence;fold;blood;capability;";"http://igem.org/2016_Judging_Form?id=2016"

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has raised concern throughout Mexico because of its incidence. The virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. Moreover, it is of crucial importance as some HPV strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. TecCEM_HS 2016 is developing a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. With careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence.

It has been found that regenerating respiratory epithelial cells of CF patients carry the asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The binding of the B-subunit to its receptor molecules results in the internalization, probably by endocytosis, of the protein, together with its linked cargo plasmid.

As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution.

We aim to stably produce, sense and export fumarate under conditions mimicking industrial settings. Stable production is achieved by activating and evolving different metabolic modules in response to natural day/night cycles. To detect fumarate, we developed a biosensor suitable for high-throughput screening. Finally, to allow optimal fumarate export, we investigate its transport mechanism.

Two ecological and economical challenges to interplanetary travel arise: the sustainable management of waste produced on a spaceship and the astronomical cost of shipping materials to space. The iGEM Calgary 2017 team used genetically engineered E. coli (expressing genes from Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to turn human waste into poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a bioplastic. Our engineered E. coli also secrete the PHB they produce, which improves the efficiency of the system. Our project is a start-to-finish integrated system that can be used in space to generate items useful to astronauts during early Mars missions. This will solve the problem of waste management by upcycling solid human waste into a usable product. It will also reduce astronautical costs, as fuel typically used to ship materials to space can be saved.";"Astroplastic: from colon to colony";"solid human waste;sustainable management of waste;problem of waste management;coli;PHB;colonization of Mars;integrated system;early Mars missions;astronomical cost of shipping materials;interplanetary travel;genes;astronauts;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;items useful;Ralstonia eutropha;spaceship;economical challenges;team;usable product;start;fuel;exploration;iGEM Calgary;hydroxybutyrate;poly;private enterprises;Governments;astronautical costs;project;efficiency;bioplastic;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2260"

Using golden gate cloning, we are generating transcriptional units for transient expression of TSHantag after agrobacterium-mediated transformation in tobacco leaves. TSHantag has been used to treat hyperthyroid disorders such as Graves’ Disease, but has not been produced in large amounts appropriate for therapeutic use. The TSHantag protein works by inhibiting autoimmune autoantibodies, which in turn decreases elevated thyroxine levels and reduces pathologic symptoms. In addition, we are expanding the set of tools available for regulating gene expression in plant synthetic biology. Currently, only a small number of regulatory elements have been introduced into the iGEM Phytobrick standard. Therefore, we are generating novel inducible promoter Phytobricks that are responsive to jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

It is crucial to find a time and cost effective procedure that will catabolize some of the most prevalent, toxic PAHs -- fluorene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene -- to innocuous compounds, such as salicylate and phthalate, which are degradable in metabolic cycles. Certain bacteria contain intermediates in their degradative pathways that simplify gene combination and nucleotide sequencing. We proposed a novel methodology for the degradation of multiple PAHs through the implementation of these bacteria-derived pathways into E. coli. This methodology allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs within an oil environment into safer residues. A broad host vector can be used to transfer the sequence’s degradation capabilities into strains different from E. coli. These bacteria can be incorporated in oil spill remediations and bioreactor use, achieving detoxification through combinatorial genetic bioremediation.";"ImPAHct: Efficient Bacterial System for the Degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Crude Oil";"toxic PAHs;degradation of multiple PAHs;oil environment;broad spectrum transformation of PAHs;Crude oil;bacteria-derived pathways;Certain bacteria;coli;oil spill remediations;degradative pathways;innocuous compounds;novel methodology;sequence’s degradation capabilities;broad host vector;bioreactor use;detoxification;implementation;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;gene combination;fluorene;strains different;combinatorial genetic bioremediation;phthalate;salicylate;naphthalene;phenanthrene;intermediates;nucleotide sequencing;safer residues;time;metabolic cycles;effective procedure;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2491"

Thus, our team, CIEI-BJ, decided to design a biosynthesis pathway to produce a special substance, Citronellol, which is nontoxic to human beings, environmental friendly, and can repel mosquitoes effectively. One of the most significant concern during production is to ensure that neither pollution nor toxin will be released. Therefore, our team transferred geraniol synthase gene (GES) and old yellow enzyme gene (OYE) to E.coli and yeast, then let them help us convert glucose into citronellol.

MicroRNA (miRNA) levels in body fluids are postulated to be effective, non-invasive biomarkers for many diseases. miRNAs hsa-mir-15b-5p and hsa-mir-27b-3p are differentially expressed in serum early in NSCLC. We designed two sequence specific sensors to quantify serum levels of these miRNAs using toehold switches, which regulate protein synthesis post-transcriptionally. Binding of an arbitrary RNA sequence to the toehold switch activates translation, producing a fluorescent reporter protein. Fluorescence intensity therefore indicates miRNA levels. This may enable miRNA level detection using toehold switches as a simple detection method for NSCLC. In future, we propose multiple switches used in tandem to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in multiple diseases simultaneously, or even several reporters with different emission peaks to create a multiplexing assay.

HD is usually adult-onset, and includes symptoms such as amnesia, involuntary movements, and physical incoordination, rendering the patient with a lifespan of a mere ten years after onset. The main cause is a trinucleotide repeat of CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, where a repeat of 40 or more can cause the disease to manifestation. Our goal is to create a synthetic RNA strand displacement technology that targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT protein.

Excreted phytic acid flows into rivers and leads to eutrophication that causes problems such as red tide, which exerts adverse effects on ecosystem and fishery. Under the status quo, people try to cope with this problem by adding phytase to the feed of livestock however, its enzyme activity is thought to be lowered when it is heated during its production. Moreover, the low pH in the stomach of livestock may also lower its activity.

To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism. After the time-delay, the circuit will trigger the production of a recombinase that splices out the genetically modified segment from the origin of replication (ORI) of the carrier vector, thus preventing replication of the genetically modified segment in the host.

The first approach requires using copious amounts of water, which is not abundantly available in many parts of the world, while the second is not cost-effective. Finally, spraying air fresheners is not a solution, as it does not get rid of ammonia.

An inducible genetic construct was made to express tsPurple (a chromoprotein) and degrade via ClpXP upon induction of varying levels of IPTG, resulting in correlating amounts of protein degradation. Data was collected on the team’s engineered Chrom-Q, a 3-D printed camera-device that supports a constant light source for centrifuged cells; in turn the data was analyzed using Lambert iGEM's self-constructed software app to determine HSL values. The purpose and goal for this technology was to promote scientific research under any financial circumstance to quantify data in standardized conditions. Measuring relative strengths of protein degradation using self-engineered products will allow an economic approach in characterizing non-lysosomal proteolysis.";"CLiP'd: Characterizing non-Lysosomal Inducible Protein Degradation";"Data;overlap of protein expression;correlating amounts of protein degradation;relative strengths of protein degradation;ClpXP;self-engineered products;Lambert iGEM's self-constructed software app;Lambert iGEM team;inducible genetic construct;development of genetic circuits;team’s engineered Chrom-Q;economic approach;issues;financial circumstance;constant light source;researchers;centrifuged cells;D printed camera-device;HSL values;induction of varying levels of IPTG;express tsPurple;technology;scientific research;non-lysosomal proteolysis;clean way;switch;standardized conditions;proteolytic mechanism;chromoprotein;result;purpose;goal;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2353"

Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment.

We designed a temperature-controlled kill switch activated below 34C using the temperature-dependent repressor TlpA36. Bacteria are lysed by constitutively expressed holin and endolysin unless counteracted by antiholin, which is under the control of TlpA36 and therefore only expressed in a narrow temperature range. This system should function with any gram-negative bacteria. We implemented our switch in E. coli as proof of concept.

To develop a novel approach for grease treatment, we designed a microbial cooperation system based on serine-mediated attraction and leucine-mediated repellent of bacteria. Our system consists of 3 Leaders (LA, LB, LC) and 2 Followers (FD, FE) that are engineered microorganisms. LA inducibly secretes serine, LB constitutively secretes leucine, and LC makes acyl-CoA synthetase long chain (ACSL) to metabolize fatty acids. Serine and leucine produced by Leaders can attract or repel FD/FE, respectively. FD secretes lipase to dissolve sewage grease into fatty acids and FE expresses a fatty acid binding protein on its membrane to carry fatty acids. When Followers are attracted to Leaders, a fatty acid-enriched microenvironment can be built to let ACSL from LC metabolize fatty acids. Thus, we developed a novel grease-degrading system consisting of differentially engineered microbial groups, similar to an assembly line in a human society.";"Coordinated Grease Eraser: Build a microbial trap for grease";"fatty acids;sewage grease;enriched grease;FE;LC;novel grease;Leaders;FD;fatty acid-enriched microenvironment;fatty acid binding protein;grease treatment;ACSL;serine-mediated attraction;microbial cooperation system;LA;Followers;leucine-mediated repellent of bacteria;Civil sewage;microbial groups;novel approach;engineered microorganisms;acyl-CoA synthetase long chain;membrane;assembly line;low biodegradability;lipase;human society;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2302"

Our research aims to build a mammalian cell-based biological odor detection system (iSmeller, intensified Smeller) with enhanced sensitivity by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology. Once an odor binds to the specific olfactory receptors on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP (cyclic AMP) which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. We implement CRISPR activation apparatus to simultaneously amplify several core components endogenously along the olfactory signal cascade to enhance power and sensitivity of the cellular odor sensor.

However, current nanorobots are limited by the precision of control: most utilize magnetic or electric field based steering. Yet, light-based control through laser technology, offers precise spatial resolution at the diffraction limit. We seek to modify the chemotactic machinery of E. coli by modulating the activity of the critical chemotaxis protein CheY. The GFP-related protein Dronpa has been demonstrated to reversibly block kinase activity through light-induced dimerization [Science 2017, 355, 836-842]. Our team has designed a novel Dronpa-CheY fusion protein to precisely control the movement of E. coli with different wavelengths of light. Since Dronpa controls CheY activity directly, the effects after exposure to light will be rapid, compared to cases controlled by gene regulation. The control of E. coli that can be precisely ‘driven’ on the micrometer-scale may revolutionize targeted medical treatment, bioanalytical sensing, and nanomanufacturing.";"Droving with Dronpa: Rapid, Reversible Control of Escherichia Coli Motility Using Light";"control of;coli;Dronpa controls CheY activity;precision of control;light-based control;novel Dronpa-CheY fusion protein;kinase activity;critical chemotaxis protein CheY;GFP-related protein Dronpa;light-induced dimerization;different wavelengths of light;current nanorobots;Real-time controllable nanorobots;precise spatial resolution;targeted medical treatment;laser technology;attractive goal of engineering;bioanalytical sensing;movement of;effects;micrometer-scale;electric field based steering;diffraction limit;exposure;cases;nanomanufacturing;robotics;Science;gene regulation;chemotactic machinery of;team;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2476"

The proteins bind via Aptamers and specific binding proteins to dCAS9. This approach is tested in E. coli while the second one will be implemented in yeast.

These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the β-oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the β-oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption.

The risk of mid-mission equipment failure, power shortages, or supply depletion incentivizes precautionary measures, but the financial strain of sending unnecessary mass into space limits this practice. To balance the two, our team explored the advantages of biological solutions, namely the self-sustaining abilities of low-mass organisms, to make planetary exploration more self-sufficient and economical. Prioritizing repair over replacement, we are developing self-healing materials embedded with Bacillus subtilis. For longer-lasting energy, we are designing a “biobactery” using linearly oriented E. coli to generate power. For renewable materials, we are engineering bacteria to synthesize and degrade rubber.

Many respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis are characterized by an excessive accumulation of thick mucus. Afflicted people suffer repeated lung infections and breathing difficulties caused by clogged airways, resulting in severely reduced quality of life. We address this issue by developing an unprecedented probiotic approach that self-regulates mucus thickness to protect and promote respiratory health. Our engineered bacteria sense the pathologically altered osmotic pressure caused by thickened mucus, thus triggering the expression of mucus degrading enzymes.

On the other hand, translational regulators are not capable of regulating multiple genes and complex genetic circuits but can be easily engineered de novo using predictive thermodynamic models. Hence an ideal regulator is found wanting, one which is capable of regulating multiple genes simultaneously and at the same time easily engineerable. ReguloGEM provides such a regulator based on the tnaC operon.

An interesting therapy for cancer using anaerobic bacteria as a carrier has been developed, but after the anaerobic cancer region is diminished, the bacteria cannot stay there anymore. If anti-cancer bacteria can stay in affected area, they promptly respond to cancer recurrence. Co-existence of bacteria and host cells should be quite difficult in our body or human cell culture systems, because bacteria grow so fast. It is important to control bacterial proliferation in them. So, we try to establish a new living system that human cells control the population of bacteria by engineering the both cells by creating two signaling pathways of 1) Bacteria-Mammals and 2) Bacteria-Plants. We expect that this system will lead to a new experimental approach and a new medical therapy.

We developed a biosensor of aflatoxin easy for household use which gives a warning of AFT levels beyond safety limit in oil and milk. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we fused two partial antibodies (single-chain variable fragments) targeting aflatoxin with Y2H elements to drive the expression of the reporter gene in response to AFT. The reporter is a hexose transporter gene linking the level of AFT detected to the concentration of glucose in medium, easily read out by a glucometer.

The constructed plasmids for these two proteins are transformed into DH5α cells for high cloning and then transformed into BL21(DE3) for high gene expression and production of the proteins of interest. Cell lysate from transformed BL21(DE3) cells is used as DNA ligase and DNA polymerase and the base level of exonuclease present naturally in the cell lysate serves as the T5 exonuclease. Using different combinations of the cell lysates for the DNA ligase and DNA polymerase, a plasmid with known sequence and properties is assembled to test the concept.

However, due to natural biochemical processes and human activities, ocean temperatures are rising by 1-2% every year. This results in coral bleaching, the loss or expulsion of zooxanthellae from its tissue, due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from photosystem I. ROSs can be converted to less toxic chemicals by superoxide dismutases (SODs), however it does not react as quickly with ROSs as does other chemicals in the cell. Our research aims to reduce the production of ROSs by characterizing three SODs. We will determine which SOD is most efficient based on its placement in the cell under abiotic stresses, such as light and heat. We will also create a chassis for Symbiodinium and construct biobricks for each individual part. In addition, a controlled water tank will be created to simulate environmental conditions.";"S.O.S!

First, we identified a dsRNA-binding chaperone, Hfq, which acts to stabilize the sRNA-mRNA duplex in order to recruit RNase III to degrade the dsRNA. We then designed complimentary sRNAs for each mRNA target and tested the affinity of Hfq to our custom designed (AU)7A binding region on the sRNAs using a fluorescence polarization assay.

"2017_Washington";"Advances in synthetic biology have lead to new, useful metabolic pathways that can be used to produce metabolites on a commercially-viable scale. However, management of these cultures is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and measuring levels of metabolites often involves prohibitively expensive analytics, such as HPLC. Our project aims to overcome these problems by providing a low-cost, automated turbidostat bioreactor that analyzes a yeast culture in real time and corrects inputs to maintain culture conditions. To test our system, we use the violacein metabolic pathway, regulated with inducible promoters, to yield four visually distinct pigments. An open-source Raspberry Pi computer collects color and opacity information about the culture, and software analyzes the color and gradually introduces the inducers to keep the culture’s production stable. By combining biological, software, and hardware systems, our design can generate previously-unavailable visual data in certain biosynthesis processes, and has a wide range of applications in industrial fermentation.";"Viva Violacein - An Affordable Real-Time Metabolics Tracker";"yeast culture;color;culture conditions;software;levels of metabolites;violacein metabolic pathway;useful metabolic pathways;certain biosynthesis processes;opacity information;open-source Raspberry Pi computer;unavailable visual data;wide range of applications;automated turbidostat bioreactor;inputs;real time;industrial fermentation;design;inducers;hardware systems;inducible promoters;synthetic biology;expensive analytics;problems;cultures;culture’s production stable;management;Advances;HPLC;viable scale;distinct pigments;project;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2391"
"2017_WashU_StLouis";"Due to numerous climate effects, photosynthetic organisms are being damaged due to increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation. Luckily, many organisms exist that have a natural resistance to this kind of radiation. Using genes from the tardigrade species Ramazzottius Varieornatus, the bacteria species Deinococcus Radiodurans, and a strain of cyanobacteria, we hope to induce resistance to UV-B radiation damage. In order to demonstrate proof of these genes’ utility, our first step was to transform the genes into E. Coli. From there, we planned to test these transformed cells in our Environmental Simulation System by irradiating the cells and comparing their growth to that of a control. So far, we have found that E. Coli cells with Dsup are substantially more resistant to UV-B radiation, and we have also recorded preliminary data on uvsE as well. Currently, we are transforming the four genes into cyanobacteria and testing them under UV-B light.";"Operation: Ultraviolet";"UV-B radiation damage;UV-B light;increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation;kind of radiation;Coli cells;transformed cells;photosynthetic organisms;natural resistance;strain of cyanobacteria;tardigrade species Ramazzottius Varieornatus;bacteria species Deinococcus Radiodurans;Environmental Simulation System;numerous climate effects;Dsup;genes’ utility;proof;step;preliminary data;uvsE;order;growth;control;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2195"
"2017_WHU-China";"Widely used in agriculture and various industries, synthetic phenolic compounds commonly exist in wastewater and have been troublesome in wastewater treatment due to their remarkable stability and acute toxicity. They can accumulate through food chains and serve as mutagens and carcinogens to people and other organisms. Among them, halogenated phenolic compounds are notablely more toxic and less bio-degradable. Even when the number of halogen atoms increases, the toxicity of the whole molecule is raised as well . To deal with this serious problem, our team aims to construct a Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor to assist the degradation of halogenated phenolic compounds in wastewater. In this device, we intend to apply an engineered Bacillus megaterium which can mainly express an original reductive dehalogenase RdhANP. And we will also make some genetic changes on this B. megaterium to scale up its efficiency in treating the wastewater containing halogenated phenols.";"Wow(WHU-iGEM operate wastewater)——biodegradation of halogenated phenol in wastewater";"degradation of halogenated phenolic compounds;wastewater treatment;synthetic phenolic compounds;halogenated phenols;acute toxicity;engineered Bacillus megaterium;remarkable stability;various industries;mutagens;carcinogens;team;Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor;agriculture;original reductive dehalogenase RdhANP;people;efficiency;number of halogen atoms;food chains;serious problem;organisms;bio-degradable;genetic changes;molecule;device;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2462"
"2017_William_and_Mary";"It has become apparent that a fundamental principle of cellular signal processing is the encoding of information within the temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits. For synthetic circuits to achieve the versatility and effectiveness of endogenous circuits, it is necessary to develop simple, effective methods to control a circuit’s speed. Current approaches to speed control are too complex for widespread use— we lack a modular system that allows one to “swap out” a sequence to predictably change a gene’s speed just as swapping an RBS can change the gene’s expression strength. To address this need, we developed a BioBrick suite of degradation tags associated with an E. coli-orthogonal protease, providing the parts and characterization necessary for controlling genetic circuit speed in a simple, modular, and predictable way. Additionally, we created a searchable database of previous iGEM teams’ outreach projects, designed to better enable future teams to build upon previous outreach efforts.";"Modular Control of Gene Expression Speed using Protein Degradation Tags";"gene’s speed;speed control;circuit’s speed;genetic circuit speed;synthetic circuits;previous outreach efforts;effectiveness of endogenous circuits;characterization necessary;temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits;modular system;searchable database of previous iGEM teams’ outreach projects;gene’s expression strength;encoding of information;fundamental principle of cellular signal processing;parts;widespread use;versatility;RBS;effective methods;BioBrick suite of degradation tags;future teams;coli-orthogonal protease;Current approaches;predictable way;need;sequence;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2333"

Infections by these bacteria can lead to severe gastrointestinal problems and even death if left untreated. Therefore, it is necessary to have water testing methods that can rapidly and accurately determine whether water sources contain these harmful pathogens. The WLC-iGEM team is working on developing a water testing kit that provides fast and accurate results using components of the Lambda Phage tail that are specific for their target bacteria. These bacteriophage tail components have been cloned and will be purified. By attaching a horseradish peroxidase enzyme (that will produce color when a substrate is added) to these bacteriophage components, E. coli should be able to be detected when present in a water sample. The high specificity and high concentration of bacteriophages should provide accurate and rapid results.";"Phage Gauge: A novel method of detecting Escherichia coli in contaminated water.";"drinking water;water resources;water sources;water sample;water testing kit;water testing methods;bacteriophage components;bacteriophage tail components;accurate results;high specificity;rapid results;target bacteria;high concentration of bacteriophages;Lambda Phage tail;Escherichia coli infection;common problem;irrigation systems;beaches;severe gastrointestinal problems;death;color;human waste;present;harmful pathogens;horseradish peroxidase enzyme;WLC-iGEM team;substrate;Infections;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2452"

Thus, it has become important to slow down the accumulation rate or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in atmosphere. Here, we hope to develop an efficient biological carbon dioxide sequestration system using Synchronous sp. PCC 7002. The capability of CO2 capturing and storage of the algae was improved by inserting foreign genes, encoding rubisco, and starch synthase. The modified strain was also designed to have an expression of a metal binding protein on its pilus to increase weight and deactivate pilus slowly, which would finally cause the alga to sink to the sea bottom permanently so as to cut off the carbon from being reused.";"Self-sinking Algae for CO2 Sequestration";"level of carbon dioxide;pilus;efficient biological carbon dioxide sequestration system;earth's atmosphere;main reason of global warming;metal binding protein;rubisco;algae;PCC;foreign genes;storage;expression;weight;capability of CO2;starch synthase;accumulation rate;modified strain;sea;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2513"

The oxygen sensitive vgb promoter and a GFP reporter constitute Oxygen detector 1.0. To enhance the expression of GFP, version 2.0 contains a vgb promoter, a T7 RNA polymerase gene, a T7 promoter and a GFP gene. For nitrogen, the PyeaR promoter was used to response to different concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and nitric, with a BFP reporter gene.

Patients with intestinal S. aureus colonization tend to suffer from fecal incontinence, diarrhea and so on. Hence, our project aims to make the most of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have a reputation for their efficient antimicrobial activity against bacteria, as new therapeutics. We genetically engineer Lactococcus lactis (Grenadier Guards) to closely detect the presence of S. aureus and throw AMPs (grenades) to eradicate them within a short time after infection. The mechanism includes utilizing the S. aureus’s own quorum sensing system as a sensor, or using the cells’ osmoregulatory system to control the expression of the AMP genes in tandem repeats, which can produce a relatively high quantity level, subsequently Lactococcus lactis will undergo autolysis controlled by a toggle switch to release AMPs to attack S. aureus, thus relieving the symptoms.";"Grenadier Guards —— using antimicrobial peptides to fight against Staphylococcus aureus";"AMPs;aureus colonization;Staphylococcus aureus;Lactococcus lactis;antimicrobial peptides;efficient antimicrobial activity;quorum sensing system;cells’ osmoregulatory system;expression;sensor;bacteria;various antibiotics;AMP genes;aureus’s;resistance;autolysis;high quantity level;reputation;tandem repeats;new therapeutics;fecal incontinence;Grenadier Guards;toggle switch;Patients;presence;short time;infection;diarrhea;grenades;antibiotic overuse;mechanism;symptoms;project;";"http://igem.org/2017_Judging_Form?id=2309"

At the same time, we designed a device based on micro-fluid chip to concentrate our engineered bacteria on improving the sensitivity of detection following the principles of modularity, cheapness and easy operation.

However, traditional cell disruption methods (including sonication and homogenization) usually need additional equipments and are laborious/time-consuming. To improve the efficiency of cell disruption and intracellular products extraction, a lysozyme-encoding gene was successfully integrated into a modified blue-light-controlled gene switch which was evaluated through eGFP gene expression. Subsequently, self-lysis of E. coli cells was assessed under blue light. To control the expression of lysis gene regulated by blue light, a model of light-emitting device was constructed and a layout of fermentor with light-emitting device was designed. Moreover, we made an economic analysis after consulting several bio-factories. It indicated that our design not only reduce the cost in cell disruption but also simplify operation process.
